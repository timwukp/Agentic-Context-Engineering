# ACE Framework (Agentic Context Engineering)

A production-ready framework for scalable context adaptation in AI applications using a three-agent architecture.

## Overview

ACE treats contexts as evolving playbooks that continuously accumulate, refine, and organize strategies over time through a modular three-agent architecture (Generator, Reflector, Curator). Instead of condensing knowledge into terse summaries, ACE prevents context collapse and brevity bias through structured incremental updates.

## Status

This repository contains the complete implementation of the ACE Framework with:
- ✅ Three-agent architecture (Generator, Reflector, Curator)
- ✅ Context management system with Redis caching and PostgreSQL persistence
- ✅ Agent lifecycle management and workflow orchestration
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (120+ tests)
- ✅ API endpoints with FastAPI
- ✅ Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
